19.02.2017 v.0.0.2
- Added RTCroutines class, which manages the rtc clock. Including setup function and getDateTimeString function.
- Changed filename used for log files to use a string with date and time in a directory with the date formatted as /DATA/YYMMDD/HHMMSS.csv .
- Added fail safe procedure that tries to make directories for log files if they don't exists.
- Changed signature of writeToFile in debugger class to use String.
- Added rtc to main.h as well. It is initialized with the other modules and its dateTimeString is passed when logging data to file.


15.02.2017 v0.0.1
- Added addresses for accelerometer as I2C slave with AD0 HIGH and LOW
- Added close() function to SDroutines which allows to do setup of sd again harmlessly
- Added setup of sd after wake up since we can now do it (NOTE: Maybe best to switch off SD with pin from micro because depending on sd type it might waste 20-40m)
- Various changes to debugging.
- Changed separator in log to tab because Excel picks it up as a 3 column tab right away this way.
